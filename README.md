# tic-tac-go

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, written in Go. Mostly to demonstrate a logical project layout and illustrate some common
Go idioms. It will still panic in a few cases ðŸ˜‰.

To play:

    go run cmd/main.go

Coordinates must be input as space-separated integers, representing the row and column, e.g. `0 0`, `1 0`, etc.
